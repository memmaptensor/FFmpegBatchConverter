# FFmpegBatchConverter
My collection of batch scripts using ffmpeg to convert some media formats to others

## Usage
1. Remove the .gitkeep files on both the input and output folders (do this once)
2. Move the files you want to convert into the input folder
3. (Optional) run `showInfo.bat` to see the info dump for your media files
4. Run `.bat` files according to your usage from the folders `to and from GIF`, `to audio`, `to video`
5. Copy the files from the output folder

**Note: the ffmpeg and ffprobe included with the repository is an old version, you can download newer versions from https://ffmpeg.org/ and replace the two `.exe` in your folder**
